 * Port 0x61 — PC Speaker control:
 *   Bit 0: PIT channel 2 gate  (1 = PIT channel 2 is running)
 *   Bit 1: Speaker data enable (1 = speaker output connected to PIT ch2)
 *
 * Port 0x43 — PIT command port (shared with pit.c's channel 0 setup,
 *              but we only write a channel-2 command here).
 * Port 0x42 — PIT channel 2 data port.
